My name is Varun Viswanath, and I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego working in the [DigiHealth lab](https://digihealth.ucsd.edu/) lead by [Edward Wang](https://www.ejaywang.com/) and in the [Smarr Lab](https://smarr.eng.ucsd.edu/) led by [Benjamin Smarr](https://smarr.eng.ucsd.edu/lab-members). 

I develop novel machine learning techniques to study longitudinal time-series in real-world health contexts. Currently, I am using a dataset of 60,000 real-world wearable device users to explore methods discovering longitudinal structures when detecting anomalies in wearable time series. I have broad experience in across ubiquitous computing, design research, deep learning, computer science, and bioengineering. In the future, I hope to further explore how deep learning and other statistical methods can augment wearable and ubiquitous technology to improve peoplesâ€™ health and lifestyle.

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). As an undergraduate researcher, I was advised by [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/) for 3 years as part of the [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/). My senior research thesis was on "Using Confidence in Smartphone Spirometry".

I've also interned with the [Uber Elevate](https://www.uber.com/us/en/elevate/) (Summer 2017). I maintain a list of my publications under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab.
