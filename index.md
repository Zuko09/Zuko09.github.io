My name is Varun Viswanath, and I am a 5th year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego working in the [DigiHealth lab](https://digihealth.ucsd.edu/) lead by [Edward Wang](https://www.ejaywang.com/) and in the [Smarr Lab](https://smarr.eng.ucsd.edu/) led by [Benjamin Smarr](https://smarr.eng.ucsd.edu/lab-members). 

My research focuses on how <a style="color:#4b2e83"><b>deep learning</b></a> can transform mobile and <a style="color:#4b2e83"><b>wearable healthcare</b></a>. My research to date has focused on identifying health outcomes from wearable PPG and temperature data. My prior work focused on novel uses of smartphones with deep learning to predict medical outcomes.

Specifically, I've explored how wearable device data can predict the onset of illnesses like [COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07314-0) and how [biases](https://openreview.net/forum?id=W0pLyiSuSSa) can challenge such illness detection tasks. I've recently been studying sleep phenotypes and diabetes in the context of wearable health data, as well as how large cohort wearable datasets (N>60,000) can be leveraged to improve health algorithms. I previously explored how smartphones can predict [lung condition (smartphone spirometry)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30441582/) and [blood oxygen percentage (smartphone oximetry)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00665-y). In the future, I hope to further explore how deep learning and other statistical methods can augment wearable and ubiquitous technology to improve peoplesâ€™ health and lifestyle.

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). As an undergraduate researcher, I was advised by [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/) for 3 years as part of the [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/). My senior research thesis was on "Using Confidence in Smartphone Spirometry". I've also interned with the [Uber Elevate](https://www.uber.com/us/en/elevate/) (Summer 2017). I maintain a list of my publications under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab.
