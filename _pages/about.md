I am currently a fifth year PhD student at UC San Diego, where I'm working on novel data analyses with the TemPredict dataset, a dataset of wearable data from 60 thousand Oura ring users collected over 6-12 months.

In my first year, I worked on novel analyses and evaluations for smartphone oximetry. In my second year, I worked on the acute detection of COVID-19 with a wearable device. In my third year, I studied how wearable-based illness detection algorithms might scale to thousands of users, and found these algorithms struggled in real world contexts. In my fourth year, I explored how sleep patterns and weekend patterns could be used to explain which real world contexts these algorithms could perform better or worse in. Now, in my fifth year, I am testing how contextual information can allow wearable-based algorithms to perform in the real world.

As a Ph.D. student, I've had the pleasure of mentoring several students I'm very proud of. Amit Klein worked on many deep learning illness tasks and published about periodic patterns in wearable deep learning at an ICML workshop on time series. Jake Ryan worked on training deep learning models on wavelet images of wearable data to identify fevers at scale by leveraging pretrained image models. Shreenithi Navaneethan is working on methods of screening for diabetic individuals with PPG and distal temperature data. With the [ENLACE](https://summer.ucsd.edu/program-finder/enlace.html) program, I've mentored students from Tijuana and other parts of Latin America, and one group of these students published their work. 

As the Student Volunteer Co-chair of the [Ubicomp 2023](https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2023/) conference in Cancun, Mexico, I directed more than 40 students, from undergraduates to recent PhDs, and collaborated with countless faculty to organize the premier interdisciplinary venue for ubiquitous, pervasive and wearable computing conference. While it was an intense and fast-paced experience, it will remaine the most fulfilling periods of my academic career.

I am hoping to defend and graduate near the end of this school year. 

I'm also a long time chess player, who used to run the University of Washington chess club and force everyone around him to play bughouse. I love to read and journal. During my time in San Diego, I've become a dedicated boxer and I dabble in other combat sports.

<!-- I am currently a Research Scientist in Google (since August 2023), where I am working in the [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) team. Our team works on improving model quality, factuality, and evaluation of Bard.

I recently finished my PhD at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu/) in the College for Information and Computer Science. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mohit Iyyer](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/) and worked on exciting problems in long-form text generation. I used to co-organize the [Machine Learning and Friends Lunch](https://umass-mlfl.github.io/) at UMass Amherst (Fall 2019 - Spring 2022). I graduated with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in) in 2018. I was a part of the [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/) group and was advised by [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/), working on problems in language modeling and sentiment classification.

I've spent some excellent summers in industry and academia via internships. In Summer 2022, I interned at Semantic Scholar in [AI2](https://allenai.org/), working with Kyle Lo, Arman Cohan and Pradeep Dasigi on human evaluation of long-form summarization. In Summer 2021, I interned at the Google Research India team with Partha Talukdar and Bidisha Samanta working on low-resource multilingual style transfer. In Summer 2020, I interned at the [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain) team with [Aurko Roy](https://sites.google.com/site/royaurko) working on retrieval augmented generation algorithms. In Summer 2019 I worked on model extraction attacks with the [Google AI Language](https://ai.google/research/teams/language/) team in New York under the mentorship of [Gaurav Singh Tomar](https://ai.google/research/people/GauravSinghTomar/) and [Ankur Parikh](https://ai.google/research/people/104995/) and [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/).
In Summer 2017, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), a computer science research institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) campus, where I was lucky to have the joint advice of professors [Karen Livescu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~klivescu), [Liang Lu](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~llu/) and [Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/). Finally in Summer 2016, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution).

When I'm not working, I am generally [birding]({ site.url }}/birding), hiking, biking reading or star gazing. I like to [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive.html) and have written a few articles compiling my experiences with graduate school admissions, visa applications, biking etc. During my undergraduate days, I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. I also used to actively contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. Finally, I [collect]({{ site.url }}/assets/rubik.jpg) Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I am not good at solving them!

Some people on the internet (especially on Mozilla's IRC) know me as *martianwars*.
