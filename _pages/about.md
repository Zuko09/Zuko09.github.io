<b> Research </b>
I am currently a fifth year PhD student at UC San Diego, where I'm working on novel data analyses with the TemPredict dataset, a dataset of wearable data from 60 thousand Oura ring users collected over 6-12 months.

In my first year, I worked on novel analyses and evaluations for smartphone oximetry. In my second year, I worked on the acute detection of COVID-19 with a wearable device. In my third year, I studied how wearable-based illness detection algorithms might scale to thousands of users, and found these algorithms struggled in real world contexts. In my fourth year, I explored how sleep patterns and weekend patterns could be used to explain which real world contexts these algorithms could perform better or worse in. Now, in my fifth year, I am testing how contextual information can allow wearable-based algorithms to perform in the real world.

I am hoping to defend and graduate near the end of this academic year. 

<b> Mentoring and Broad Impacts </b>
As a Ph.D. student, I've had the pleasure of mentoring several students I'm very proud of. Amit Klein worked on many deep learning illness tasks and published about periodic patterns in wearable deep learning at an ICML workshop on time series. Jake Ryan worked on training deep learning models on wavelet images of wearable data to identify fevers at scale by leveraging pretrained image models. Shreenithi Navaneethan is working on methods of screening for diabetic individuals with PPG and distal temperature data. With the [ENLACE](https://summer.ucsd.edu/program-finder/enlace.html) program, I've mentored students from Tijuana and other parts of Latin America, and one group of these students published their work. 

As the Student Volunteer Co-chair of the [Ubicomp 2023](https://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp-iswc-2023/) conference in Cancun, Mexico, I directed more than 40 students, from undergraduates to recent PhDs, and collaborated with countless faculty to organize the premier interdisciplinary venue for ubiquitous, pervasive and wearable computing conference. While it was an intense and fast-paced experience, it will remaine the most fulfilling periods of my academic career.

<b> Hobbies </b>
I'm also a long time chess player, who used to run the University of Washington chess club and force everyone around him to play bughouse. I love to read and journal. During my time in San Diego, I've become a dedicated boxer and I dabble in other combat sports.
